# Machine Learning project with RFC
In this tiny project, I try to predict heart failures of patients with a provided set with Random Forest Classifier.
This data set is served on Kaggle and the reference and I would like to credit the following as citation:

Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman: Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone.
